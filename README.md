# ü©∏ About ü©∏
Sanguine is a Minecraft datapack that adds a unique take on Blood Moons. Every ten days, you'll be confronted with an eerie growl - the Blood Moon is coming. On this night, you'll see more common monster spawns and a handful of unique, powerful gory monsters to eat at your defences. Kill them and harvest their flesh to dig deeper into the ancient knowledge of blood rituals and power yourself to new heights.
